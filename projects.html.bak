              <strong>First Deliverable:</strong> Create a Basecamp post. Title the post with your name 
              and project number (example Daniel Krieglstein: Project 1). Your post should include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The URL to your Project 1 GitHub repository, and the URL to your index.html Github Pages
                  live link

              <strong>Final Deliverable:</strong> You will receive a list on your Basecamp post of required

          <h4>Requirements</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              NO CSS IN YOUR HTML FILE!!! This means no style at all. No spacing, no centering, no color, 
              no italics. Just raw html. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Absolutely no</strong> br tags or use of tables for layout. This is also considered 
              style. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Two spaces indented cascade. Each child element should be indented 2 space right of its parent. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Three images of HTML validation, one for each page. <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C 
              HTML validator</a> (<span class="redfont">-50% if it doesn't validate</span>)
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a bulleted list at the top of each page. The list items will be the file names of all 3 
              pages. This is your basic navigation. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Include at least three HTML images and one other form of media (audio or video)
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not use any pre-build code or frameworks. Write it all from scratch.
            </li>
            <li>
              Directory-based file structure for links and media. Do not use full URLs when linking to your 
              own content. Example: "css/screen.css" vs. 
              "https://dkriegls.github.io/itmd-361-spring2018/css/screen.css"
            </li>
            <li>
              At least 10 commits to your Github repository; with meaningful commit messages that accurately
              reflect your changes
            </li>
            <li>
              Git repository must contain <strong>only</strong> the files and commits from this project. Each 
              website you make for this class should have its own repository.
