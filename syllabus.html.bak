            This course will cover the creation of Web pages and sites using
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and graphical applications as well as the client
            and server architecture of the Internet and related web technologies. The creation and
            deployment of modern, standards-compliant web pages are addressed. Students create and
            deploy a Web site with multiple pages and cross-linked structures.

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Recognize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript markup and code.</li>
            <li>Select the proper mark-up tags or code to achieve a particular result.</li>

              Write valid, well-formed semantic HTML; error-free, backward- and forward-compatible CSS;
              and error-free, progressively enhanced JavaScript over HTML pages that continue to
              function in the absence of JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>Effectively comment on and format source code for maximum readability.</li>
            <li>Track the development of a project over time and collaborate with others using version control.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
          <p>At the conclusion of this course, successful students will be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Explain the client and server architecture of the internet and related web
              technologies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a basic text editor and other software tools to create web pages using HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, jQuery, and Foundation.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Research and argue for particular methods of web development that keep structure in HTML,
              design entirely in CSS, and progressively enhanced behavior in JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engage in agile, iterative web development, supported by version control.

          <p>
            The course emphasizes standards and research. You will learn to
            make websites that last and are accessible to everyone. The course avoids quick-fix shortcuts that
            too often plague web development practice and online instruction. Student work is organized around
            several major projects. All projects emphasize the courseâ€™s hands-on, theory-grounded
            approach to web development.

            Any work whose HTML does not validate will receive a 50&#x25;-point reduction, failing grade. Get in the habit early of validating

            I will check to see that you are adding proper summaries to your GitHub commits. You are also expected to help other students on Basecamp. 
            This means polite give-and-take discussions of code. Do not discuss anything else on basecamp. Practice professional and supportive critiquing.

            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
            as described in the
            <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
            work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
            design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
            open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
            legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
            dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
            sourceâ€™s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Dean of the School of Applied
            Technology, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
            violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.

            Illinois Tech prohibits all sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and 
            gender discrimination by any member of our community. This includes 
            harassment among students, staff, or faculty. Sexual harassment of a 
            student by a faculty member or sexual harassment of an employee by a 
            supervisor is particularly serious. Such conduct may easily create an 
            intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Illinois Tech encourages anyone experiencing sexual harassment or sexual 
            misconduct to speak with the Office of Title IX Compliance for information 
            on support options and the resolution process.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can report sexual harassment electronically at <a href="iit.edu/incidentreport">incident report</a>, 
            which may be completed anonymously. You may additionally report by contacting 
            the Title IX Coordinator, Virginia Foster at foster@iit.edu or the Deputy Title 
            IX Coordinator, Esther Espeland at eespeland@iit.edu.
